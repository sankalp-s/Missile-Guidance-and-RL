# Missile-Guidance-and-RL
- Studied RL agent based Guidance Laws and Optimal Control techniques for Surface-to-Air Missile Guidance
- Simulated optimal trajectory for surface to air ballistic missile by implementing Gradient method as optimization 
  technique in MATLAB under the guidance of Dr. Prem Kumar(Scientist- ‘F’, DOS)}
- Implemented Proportional Navigation(PN Classical Guidance law) on a point mass 3-d model in MATLAB with lofting and 
  used it as a baseline for performance evaluation against RL agent based guidance laws
